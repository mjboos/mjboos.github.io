excerpt: 'In neuroimaging, voxel-wise encoding models are a popular tool to predict brain activity elicited by a stimulus. To evaluate the accuracy of these predictions across multiple voxels, one can choose between multiple quality metrics. However, each quality metric requires specifying auxiliary parameters such as the number and selection criteria of voxels, whose influence on model validation is unknown. In this study, we systematically vary these parameters and observe their effects on three common quality metrics of voxel-wise encoding models in two open datasets of 3- and 7-Tesla BOLD fMRI activity elicited by musical stimuli. We show that such auxiliary parameters not only exert substantial influence on model validation, but also differ in how they affect each quality metric. Finally, we give several recommendations for validating voxel-wise encoding models that may limit variability due to different numbers of voxels, voxel selection criteria, and magnetic field strengths.
