[Unsupervised Drinking](https://github.com/mjboos/unsupervised_drinking) allows you to specify what cocktail ingredients you have, then projects all possible cocktails into a latent space in which similar cocktails are clustered close together. A tasty way of exploring your <b>latent cocktail space</b> and finding new recipes you might like - field tested and guaranteed to improve your party [CITATION NEEDED].
Under the hood it is a collection of Python scripts that can be run as a [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) server and utilize [Uniform Manifold Approximation](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for projecting recipes into a 2D space.
