title: "My solution to the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge on Kaggle"
excerpt: "This was my first Kaggle challenge that I took seriously and I managed to get into the top 3% (119th place out of 4550 teams) - nothing to brag about, but a great learning experience nonetheless. You can find my solution [here](https://github.com/mjboos/jigsaw)."
