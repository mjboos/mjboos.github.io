I am broadly interested in how machine learning can help us understand the brain better.
For this I use models of various kinds to predict brain activity (in MEG, ECoG, and fMRI) from a complex auditory stimulus.
Specifically, I focus on how probabilistic unsupervised learning fits into this picture, and how to increase the interpretability of Deep Neuronal Networks to harness their potential for predicting brain activity.
