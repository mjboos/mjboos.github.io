I'm a data scientist and former computational cognitive neuroscientist. I'm interested in various kinds of machine learning applications but have focused mostly on natural language processing and speech recognition. I've also worked on Bayesian hierarchical models in a scientific context and am always keen to add a probabilistic twist to whatever I'm working on.
During my PhD I used machine learning to understand speech processing in the brain better; specifically, I focused on the potential of probabilistic unsupervised learning and interpretable deep neural networks to predict brain activity.
