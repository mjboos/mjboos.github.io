I am broadly interested in how machine learning can help us understand the brain better and how to build open tools that make research easier and more reproducible.
Specifically, I focus on the potential of probabilistic unsupervised learning as stimulus representations and how to increase the interpretability of Deep Neuronal Networks to harness their potential for predicting brain activity.
