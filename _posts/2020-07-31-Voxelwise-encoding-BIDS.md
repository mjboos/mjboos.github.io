# An example workflow for voxel-wise encoding models using a BIDS app

This shows how to (for a BIDS compliant dataset) extract features, save them in BIDS format, and run a BIDS app for voxel-wise encoding models.
We are going to use [this](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002322/versions/1.0.4) dataset.

#### *Warning*: Executing this notebook will download the full dataset.


```python
!aws s3 sync --no-sign-request s3://openneuro.org/ds002322 ds002322-download/
```

## Extracting a stimulus representation

The dataset in question consists of fMRI activity recorded of several participants while they listened to a reading of the first chapter of Lewis Carrollâ€™s Alice in Wonderland.
First we want to extract a stimulus representation that we can use - I chose a Mel spectrogram for demonstration.
[This](https://github.com/mjboos/audio2bidsstim/) small Python script extracts such a representation and saves it in a BIDS compliant format. 


```python
import json
# these are the parameters for extracting a Mel spectrogram
# for computational ease in this example we want 1 sec segments of 31 Mel frequencies with a max frequency of * KHz
mel_params = {'n_mels': 31, 'sr': 16000, 'hop_length': 16000, 'n_fft': 16000, 'fmax': 8000}
with open('config.json', 'w+') as fl:
    json.dump(mel_params, fl)

!git clone https://github.com/mjboos/audio2bidsstim/
!pip install -r audio2bidsstim/requirements.txt
!python audio2bidsstim/wav_files_to_bids_tsv.py ds002322-download/stimuli/DownTheRabbitHoleFinal_mono_exp120_NR16_pad.wav -c config.json
!ls -l
```

Now we must copy these files into the BIDS dataset directory according to [these](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/06-physiological-and-other-continuous-recordings.html) specifications.
We are going to use the `derivatives` folder for the already preprocessed data.


```python
!cp audio2bidsstim/DownTheRabbitHoleFinal_mono_exp120_NR16_pad.tsv.gz ds002322-download/derivatives/task-alice_stim.tsv.gz
!cp audio2bidsstim/DownTheRabbitHoleFinal_mono_exp120_NR16_pad.json ds002322-download/derivatives/sub-18/sub-18_task-alice_stim.json
```

And, lastly, because for this dataset the derivatives folder is missing timing information for the BOLD files - we are only interested in the TR - we have to copy that as well.


```python
!cp ds002322-download/sub-18/sub-18_task-alice_bold.json ds002322-download/derivatives/sub-18/sub-18_task-alice_bold.json 
```

Now we're all set and can run our encoding analysis. This analysis uses standard Ridge regression, and we're going to specify some additional parameters here.


```python
ridge_params = {'alphas': [1e-1, 1, 100, 1000], 'n_splits': 3}

# and for lagging the stimulus as well - we want to include 6 sec stimulus segments to predict fMRI
lagging_params = {'lag_time': 6}
with open('encoding_config.json', 'w+') as fl:
    json.dump(ridge_params, fl)
    
with open('lagging_config.json', 'w+') as fl:
    json.dump(lagging_params, fl)
```

Now we just need [this](https://github.com/mjboos/voxelwiseencoding) BIDS app for running the analysis.
Running this cell will fit voxel-wise encoding models, which right now need about 8 Gig of RAM. 


```python
!git clone https://github.com/mjboos/voxelwiseencoding
!pip install -r voxelwiseencoding/requirements.txt
!mkdir output
!python voxelwiseencoding/run.py ds002322-download/derivatives output --task alice --skip_bids_validator --participant_label 18
```

Now we'll have some ridge regressions saved in output, as well as scores saved as a Nifti file - which we can visualize.
